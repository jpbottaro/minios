- Most of the issues come from changing the fs image from linux. Apparently
  when removing/moving/copying files, it clears blocks that it should not...

  Also, there is something wrong with the block/inode arrays, its reporting
  that used blocks arent.. if I create files or folders, it overrides the
  contents of the file "readme" for example.

- The header of the apps have a wrong size, they report much more that they
  really have.

- calling 'ls' and the 'cat readme' throws #GP
