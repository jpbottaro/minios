- Most of the issues come from changing the fs image from linux. Apparently
  when removing/moving/copying files, it clears blocks that it should not... It
  is probably doing something I'm not aware it's valid in minixfs

  Also, there is something wrong with the block/inode arrays, its reporting
  that used blocks aren't, if I create files or folders, it overrides the
  contents of the file "readme" for example.

- The header of the apps have a wrong size, they report much more that they
  really have.

- Weird behaviour when:
    cp hola.txt a
    rm a
    cp readme a
    cat a
    (now a is missing some text)
