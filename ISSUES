- Most of the issues come from changing the fs image from linux. Apparently
  when removing/moving/copying files, it clears blocks that it should not...
  Now the image is stable but any change on it could corrupt any block

  Also, there is something wrong with the block/inode arrays, its reporting
  that used blocks arent.. if I create files or folders, it overrides the
  contents of the file "readme" for example.

- Strange #GP happening randomly when returning from last write() system call
  in cat, when printing a file with more than 1 block (eg cat readme).
